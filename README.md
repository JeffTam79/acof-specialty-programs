"A Community of Friends (ACOF) is a 501(c)(3) organization that develops, owns, and manages affordable rental housing, with the mission of ending homelessness through the provision of quality Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) for people with mental illness. Guided by the Housing First approach, ACOF ensures that people experiencing chronic homelessness are offered immediate access to safe, stable housing without preconditions. From there, we deliver integrated support services that promote long-term stability, wellness, and personal growthâ€”creating a foundation for individuals and families to rebuild their lives with dignity and purpose."
